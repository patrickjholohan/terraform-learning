ChatGPT was used to generate the terraform files to build an Azure Virtual Machine.

These files were generated intentially with errors to learn some of the errors you may encounter when troubleshooting.

Summary of Errors
1. main.tf (root module): Missing closing curly brace } at the end of the file.
2. variables.tf (root module): Incorrect type for subnet_address_prefix, should be string.
3. outputs.tf (root module): Incorrect attribute module.vm.vm_ids, should be module.vm.vm_id.
4. terraform.tfvars: subnet_address_prefix should be in quotes to be treated as a string.
5. modules/vm/main.tf: network_interface_ids should be a list: [var.network_interface_id].
6. modules/vm/variables.tf: Incorrect type for network_interface_id, should be string.
7. modules/vm/outputs.tf: Incorrect attribute azurerm_virtual_machine.example.ids, should be azurerm_virtual_machine.example.id.

These errors will need to be fixed for the configuration to work correctly.
